        # 1. when init update_database, you want to webscrape first to get trending, notable collections, dropping
        # 2. you want to cross-check the set of collection-slugs so you really only update the new collections being added to save time & memory  
        # 3. go ahead and update database by making an API call of whats needed and whats new
        # 4. I DONT THINK THIS IS NECESSARY but update all of exisitng collection-slus. but why? do collection nft get added more, remove or change. Not really but what is delta is the event_types all 8 types
